# Vibe Vibe Code<sup>&copy;</sup>

Have you heard of "vibe coding"? What about Vibe Vibe Coding<sup>&copy;</sup>? Piqued your interest? Of course it did! As vibe coding uses "Artificial" Intelligence, we here at Vibe Vibe Corp<sup>&trade;</sup> have decided to upgrade it to use Actual Intelligence<sup>&copy;</sup>!

Vibe Vibe Code<sup>&copy;</sup> is a groundbreaking code and text editor designed from the ground-up to provide only the latest in code-editing ability with stunning features such as saving, loading, editing, and the pivotal Complex Vibes<sup>&copy;</sup> production. There really is no better way to integrate yourself, your vibes, and your intelligence (Actual<sup>&copy;</sup> or not) into the code you produce.

We here at Vibe Vibe Corp<sup>&trade;</sup> seek only to make sure that you can get your job done. This includes our amazing AI<sup>&copy;</sup> driven workflow, where our own custom Complex Vibes<sup>&copy;</sup> models can provide Vibe Feedback<sup>&copy;</sup> directly on the code you edit, in real-time!

At the moment we're in our early stages of production, and so would appreciate any funding to our project, with the best way to do this available at this link: [donate](https://news.rr.nihalnavath.com/news/Donate-32ff428e)
